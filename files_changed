	clausify:  no change
	command:   assign/2 to assign_cmd/2.
	define:	   new
	exprules:  no change
	fls:	   cputime, line 70, bagof1 the first argument X changed to Z.
	hyper:	   cputime, hl_literals call at 286,  proc_C at 792
	instdel:   cputime, 52 add erase(Ref1)
	interp:	   cputime, interp_1 added interp_1_define to take care of
